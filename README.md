Now hosted online at https://sc4proptexturecatalog.azurewebsites.net/. The current version 3.x+ was rebuilt completely from the ground up using a SQLite database, which was a necessity with the ever-growing index of items.

Building upon the original the original [Prop & Texture Photo Catalog](https://sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?board=415.0) started in 2011, this work includes all known dependency packs to date. This catalog was assembled by [nos.17](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/455740-nos17/) with assistance from STEX Custodian (Tyberius06) and Cyclone Boom, and CorinaMarie.

# Who is this for?
I hope this tool will prove invaluable for many content creators (and especially lotters) who are looking for more and better content to incorporate into their work. Looking for a motorcycle to add to your lot? Filter only prop packs that contain vehicles and/or motorcycles. Looking for seasonal trees? Look through all packs that contain seasonal trees until you can find the right ones for you? Want to use all HD? Scour all packs that contain High Definition props to find the ones you want.

# How do I use this?
The easiest way is to use is to visit the [website](https://sc4proptexturecatalog.azurewebsites.net/). An offline solution is in the works and will be posted as a release on this page when avilable.

You can download the legacy 2.x.x version with compiled photos of each pack [here](https://github.com/noah-severyn/SC4PropTextureCatalog/releases/tag/2.2.2). Due to the dramatic increase in TGIs and dependency packs tracked in this newer version, I have discontinued the images of each prop pack. Adding thumbnail photos of each TGI is on the roadmap, which will ultimately replace that functionality included in the legacy version.

If you'd like to do your own analysis against the dataset, use the database directly. The DB is hosted in this repo ([link](https://github.com/noah-severyn/SC4PropTextureCatalog/blob/main/Data/Catalog.db)). Use a database browser (I recommend [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)) and run your own SQL queries.

# I found a problem! / I have a suggestion!
Found a bug? Am I missing a prop or texture pack? Have an idea for additional sorting/filtering categories? Is there a better way to make the Catalog more interactive or useful? I would very much like to hear from you! Drop me a message or visit the [SimCity 4 Prop and Texture Catalog](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/758501-simcity-4-prop-and-texture-catalogue-by-stex-custodian/). Alternatively if you are familiar with GitHub, open an issue here.
